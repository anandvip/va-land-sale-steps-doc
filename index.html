    I came accross this property dealer yesterday called praveen goswami. Regarding the land sale decision of mine.
    
    Context for this chat in particular narrative rings a bell that property dealers are pretty much evolved around their clientele.
    Half Fact disclosure:
    PG refers to praveen goswami 
    Pg was in touch with other dealers and they were blocking him to reveal my contact details but the local intelligence brought him close to the patwari at tehsil and used patwari as first contact to reach me and confirm that if I am willing to sell the portion of the land.[i said yes] And patwari confirmed with me if he can share my contact with the PG. [I said yes]. 
    The reveal: 
    Shortly after i recieved the call from PG and he said the other property dealers whom he bypassed were holding him make advance payment through them and to that PG was not ready to admit hence bypassed the other dealers and established direct contact with me.
    I need to know and wrap my head around it. 
    What is going on behind my back? Can you help me see the clear picture these creatures property dealers class doing?
  </div>
  
  <div class="assistant-response">
    This situation you’re describing with Praveen Goswami (PG) and the other property dealers reveals a common, murky dynamic in local real estate markets, especially where land sales involve multiple intermediaries and local officials. Here’s a clearer picture of what’s likely happening behind your back:

    ---

    <h3>1. <strong>Property Dealer Network & Gatekeeping</strong></h3>

    - <strong>Property dealers often form informal or formal networks or cartels.</strong> They work with or against each other to control access to sellers and buyers.
    - <strong>Other dealers were blocking PG</strong> from getting your contact because they want to keep their "exclusive" control over your land sale opportunity.
    - They want to <strong>force PG to pay them an "advance" or commission</strong> just to get access to the seller — which is you.

    ---

    <h3>2. <strong>Bypassing the Network</strong></h3>

    - PG found a <strong>shortcut via the Patwari</strong> (a government land record official), which is crucial because the Patwari is an insider with access to local landowners and official records.
    - By contacting the Patwari first, PG could <strong>get your direct permission and contact</strong>, bypassing the gatekeeping dealers.
    - This is PG’s way of <strong>cutting through the cartel to avoid paying kickbacks or fees to other dealers</strong>.

    ---

    <h3>3. <strong>What This Means for You</strong></h3>

    - PG is <strong>trying to position himself as your direct dealer or middleman</strong>, to get exclusive access to your land sale.
    - The other dealers want to <strong>maintain their hold on you as a seller</strong>, and probably to demand their cut or commission.
    - The Patwari’s involvement suggests <strong>local officialdom is tied into this network</strong>, which is typical but risky, because it may complicate transparency or fairness.

    ---

    <h3>4. <strong>Why Are They Doing This?</strong></h3>

    - <strong>Property dealers profit by controlling who can sell and buy land</strong> in their area.
    - They want to <strong>maximize their commission or bribes</strong> by creating artificial scarcity of access.
    - By “blocking” PG and demanding advance payments from him, they want to <strong>protect their turf</strong> and revenue.
    - PG bypassing others and admitting it means he wants a direct line to you — likely hoping for a better deal or bigger commission.

    ---

    <h3>5. <strong>Risks and Red Flags</strong></h3>

    - This network behavior often <strong>leads to inflated prices, manipulation, or worse, fraud</strong>.
    - You might be pressured into selling at unfair terms or through unreliable channels.
    - The involvement of the Patwari could mean <strong>official records and permissions might be leveraged or influenced</strong> in favor of certain dealers.

    ---

    <h3>6. <strong>How to Protect Yourself</strong></h3>

    - <strong>Do not rush into any deal through PG or anyone else without full transparency.</strong>
    - Insist on <strong>detailed written communication</strong> from all parties.
    - Ask for all <strong>legal documents and confirmations from official records yourself</strong> — do not rely solely on dealers or Patwari.
    - Consider <strong>consulting an independent lawyer or trusted official</strong> outside this network for guidance.
    - Make clear to PG and others that you want to deal <strong>only with verified buyers and official procedures</strong>.
    - Keep a <strong>record of all contacts, calls, and agreements</strong>.

    ---

    <strong>Summary:</strong>  
    The “creatures” you call property dealers are playing a classic territorial game where they form alliances and blockades to extract commissions and control land sales. PG is trying to get around these barriers by using local official contacts and direct seller consent. The whole ecosystem often mixes official roles (like the Patwari) with informal power plays, which can complicate and threaten your control and transparency.

    If you want, I can help you draft a checklist or strategy to deal with such property dealers, protect your interests, and keep control firmly in your hands. Would you like that?
  </div>
  
  <div class="user-prompt">
    I have my boundary lines drawn clearly.  
    1. Person who will be the owner post sale will be in my direct line of communication.  
    2. All transactions will occur from his bank account only.  
    3. My primary condition is all transactions will be in white. No black money in the deal  
    4. Market rate agreed upon shall be disclosed in written.  
    5. Source of white money will be run through me prior to the written agreement.after verification of the money sources.  
    6. Buyer's pan aadhar card details will be available to me all time.  
    7. Buyer will not seek time gap between advance and registration of the sales the date of registration will be disclosed prior to the advance.  
    8. If the intended date is missed legally time matters.  
    The advance payment will be non refundable.  
    9. The registration will be signed only after full payment receipt.  
    Am I missing something here?
  </div>
  
  <div class="assistant-response">
    Your boundary lines are <strong>very clear and well thought out</strong>, showing strong intent to keep the deal transparent, legal, and fully under your control. This is excellent.

    Here are a few additional points and clarifications you might want to consider adding or keeping in mind to <strong>strengthen your protections</strong> further:

    ---

    <h3>Additional Points to Consider</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Verification of Ownership & Encumbrance Certificate</strong>  
      - Before finalizing, verify <strong>title clearances</strong> and <strong>encumbrance certificates</strong> to ensure the land is free from any legal disputes, mortgages, or liens.</li>

      <li><strong>Due Diligence on Buyer’s Identity</strong>  
      - Besides PAN and Aadhaar, confirm <strong>buyer’s current residential address proof</strong> and <strong>contact details</strong>.  
      - Possibly get a declaration from the buyer confirming they have no legal hindrances to buy.</li>

      <li><strong>Inclusion of a Specific Timeline Clause</strong>  
      - Define maximum allowed days for completing registration after the advance (e.g., “Registration must be completed within 30 days from advance payment.”)  
      - Include consequences if deadlines are not met (other than advance forfeiture), e.g., legal action or penalties.</li>

      <li><strong>Stamp Duty and Registration Fees</strong>  
      - Clarify who will bear <strong>stamp duty and registration fees</strong> (usually buyer, but good to specify).</li>

      <li><strong>Payment Mode Specification</strong>  
      - Explicitly mention <strong>acceptable payment modes</strong> (e.g., bank transfer, cheque) to avoid cash payments.  
      - Clarify no cash payments accepted to reinforce “white money” condition.</li>

      <li><strong>Clause on Buyer’s Financial Verification</strong>  
      - Consider stating a <strong>deadline for your money source verification</strong> of the buyer’s funds before advance payment.</li>

      <li><strong>Possibility of Third-Party Witness or Lawyer</strong>  
      - You might want to have a <strong>neutral third party or legal counsel witness or oversee</strong> the advance payment and agreement to avoid disputes.</li>

      <li><strong>Advance Payment Receipt & Agreement Document</strong>  
      - Ensure <strong>advance payment receipt is issued with clear terms</strong>.  
      - Draft a <strong>sale agreement or memorandum of understanding</strong> before advance payment covering all points.</li>

      <li><strong>Right to Cancel/Abort in Case of Fraud</strong>  
      - Add a clause that you reserve the right to cancel the sale <strong>if buyer is found involved in fraudulent or illegal activity</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>Dispute Resolution Mechanism</strong>  
      - Mention the <strong>legal jurisdiction or forum</strong> where any disputes will be resolved (e.g., local civil court).</li>
    </ol>

    ---

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    You have the essential boundaries right, especially around transparency, payment in white, and direct communication with the buyer.

    Adding the above points will help <strong>make your position legally watertight and clarify all expectations</strong>, leaving no room for manipulation or delays.

    <h2>1. Why Did I Sense Possible Fraud in the Property Dealer Situation?</h2>

    The scenario with Praveen Goswami (PG) and the other dealers raised red flags typical in many real estate markets with informal dealer networks. Here’s why:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dealer Network Cartels & Gatekeeping:</strong>  
      When multiple dealers block each other from direct access to the seller and demand advance payments as “permission fees,” it’s often a <strong>turf war to extract maximum commissions</strong> or control over a property sale. This artificial blocking and demanding payment upfront can be a <strong>sign of racketeering or blackmail-like behavior</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>Use of Local Officials (Patwari) as Middlemen:</strong>  
      The involvement of the Patwari, a government official, as a “bridge” suggests the line between officialdom and informal influence is blurred. Such influence can be misused to <strong>manipulate records or pressure sellers</strong>, increasing your risk.</li>

      <li><strong>Lack of Transparency & Pressure Tactics:</strong>  
      PG admitting to bypassing other dealers because they demanded advance money signals a <strong>shadow economy around the transaction</strong> with unofficial money flow and possible undisclosed commissions or bribes.</li>

      <li><strong>Potential for Unfair Deals or Fraudulent Practices:</strong>  
      These dynamics often lead to <strong>non-transparent pricing, forged documents, forced sales, or delayed registrations</strong>, which can cause serious loss or legal trouble for you as a seller.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong>  
    Such patterns are classic signals of a <strong>system designed to extract extra fees, manipulate ownership, and keep sellers out of full control.</strong> Hence, the caution.

    <h2>2. Your Boundary Conditions — What’s Missing? Why Contingency Plans Matter</h2>

    Your boundary conditions are solid and clear about <strong>how you want the transaction to happen</strong>. But any real estate deal can face hiccups, delays, or disputes. Here’s why contingency plans are crucial and what you can add:

    ---

    <h3>a) Contingency for Deal Falling Apart</h3>

    - <strong>What if the buyer backs out after advance payment?</strong>  
      You said advance is non-refundable. That’s good. But also <strong>state explicitly what happens if the buyer refuses to register or delays indefinitely</strong>.  
      <em>Stress</em>: Include a clause allowing you to <strong>resell the property without notice after a fixed grace period.</strong>

    - <strong>What if buyer’s white money verification fails or buyer is found unreliable?</strong>  
      Your current condition requires verification before agreement. You should add the right to <strong>cancel the deal immediately without penalty</strong> if verification is unsatisfactory.

    ---

    <h3>b) Delay in Registration</h3>

    - You said advance is non-refundable and registration must happen on disclosed date. That’s clear, but:  
      - <strong>Add specific penalties or interest on the buyer for delays beyond the agreed date.</strong>  
      - Specify a <strong>maximum number of days allowed as grace period</strong> before you can cancel the deal.  
      - Clarify <strong>who bears costs if registration is delayed for buyer’s fault</strong>.

    ---

    <h3>c) Dispute Resolution and Legal Recourse</h3>

    - What if disagreements arise about payments, delays, or document authenticity?  
      - Include a clause about <strong>jurisdiction (local court) or arbitration</strong>.  
      - Have a provision for <strong>recovering damages and legal costs</strong> from the buyer in case of breach.

    ---

    <h3>d) Verification of Transaction Records</h3>

    - <strong>Regular updates on payment receipt and transaction status</strong> from buyer’s bank to you or your authorized person.  
    - Right to <strong>audit or check payment proof</strong> anytime before final registration.

    ---

    <h3>e) Transfer of Possession and Liability</h3>

    - Clearly state <strong>when possession and liability of the property transfers to buyer</strong> (usually after registration and full payment).  
    - Include a clause about <strong>buyer’s responsibility for property from that date</strong> to avoid disputes.

    ---

    <h2>3. Steps You Must Stress to Safeguard Yourself</h2>

    - <strong>Get everything in writing</strong> — all agreements, deadlines, payment schedules, verification results, and communication must be documented.  
    - <strong>Use independent legal counsel</strong> to draft, review, and witness documents.  
    - <strong>Verify buyer’s identity and financial sources thoroughly</strong> before accepting any money.  
    - <strong>Never accept cash payments</strong> or informal transfers — insist on banking channel transfers with clear audit trails.  
    - <strong>Set clear penalties for breach and missed deadlines</strong> to discourage delay tactics.  
    - <strong>Retain the right to cancel the deal and resell</strong> without penalty if the buyer defaults or behaves fraudulently.  
    - <strong>Keep control of the sale process; do not delegate to dealers or agents without clear authority.</strong>
